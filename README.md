# Node.js Word Guessing Game

This is a command-line word guessing game, that uses npm and different object-oriented topics like classes, subclasses, objects, methods, constructors, etc. <br/>
It uses `node.js`, `inquirer`, `chalk`, and `jest` for testing (devDependency).<br/>
Navigate to the directory, run `npm i` in the terminal, then run either `npm start` or `node index.js`.<br/>
For testing, run `npm test`.
