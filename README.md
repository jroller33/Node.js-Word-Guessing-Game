# Node.js OOP Word Guessing Game

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)


This is a Node.js word guessing game that uses OOP concepts like classes, subclasses, prototypes, constructors, methods, etc. <br/>
Dependencies are `inquirer`, `chalk`, and `jest`. <br/>
## Instructions:
Navigate to the directory, run `npm i` in the terminal, then run either `npm start` or `node index.js`.<br/>
For testing, run `npm test`. 'Letter' and 'Word' classes should pass the tests in './test/'

This game basically works like wheel of fortune. After you get 10 letters/numbers wrong it's game over. It only accepts letters and numbers as input. All of the phrases are movie titles.
